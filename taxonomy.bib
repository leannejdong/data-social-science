The Gaussian copula provides a mathematically convenient framework to handle various forms of dependence in regression models arising, for example, in time series, longitudinal studies or spatial data. The package gcmr implements maximum likelihood inference for Gaussian copula marginal regression. The likelihood function is approximated with a sequential importance sampling algorithm in the discrete case. The package is designed to allow a flexible specification of the regression model and the dependence structure. Illustrations include negative binomial modeling of longitudinal count data, beta regression for time series of rates and logistic regression for spatially correlated binomial data.},

  abstract = "In neuroscience, as in many other fields of science and engineering, it is crucial to assess the causal interactions among multivariate time series. Granger causality has been increasingly used to identify causal influence between time series based on multivariate autoregressive models. Such an approach is based on linear regression framework with implicit Gaussian assumption of model noise residuals having constant variance. As a consequence, this measure cannot detect the cause-effect relationship in high-order moments and nonlinear causality. Here, we propose an effective model-free, copula-based Granger causality measure that can be used to reveal nonlinear and high-order moment causality. We first formulate Granger causality as the log-likelihood ratio in terms of conditional distribution, and then derive an efficient estimation procedure using conditional copula. We use resampling techniques to build a baseline null-hypothesis distribution from which statistical significance can be derived. We perform a series of simulations to investigate the performance of our copula-based Granger causality, and compare its performance against other state-of-the-art techniques. Our method is finally applied to neural field potential time series recorded from visual cortex of a monkey while performing a visual illusion task."
