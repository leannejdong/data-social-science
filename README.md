# skill-taxonomy-modelling

The project concerns with **Adaptive skills taxonomy to enable labor market agility**. One of the grand challenge is to capture data about changing demand and supply of skills in a timely and efficient manner which will provide much-needed information to inform educational and employment decisions To this end, we need to establish whether job advertisements accurately reflect sector-specific and geographic differences in demand for skills. Between July and September, we conduct a survey of employers which we can use to test the taxonomy generated from our analysis of the job advertisements. The goal of this presentation is to demonstrate our research outputs from temporal **dependency** modelling of job count data.
